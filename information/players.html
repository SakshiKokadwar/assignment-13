Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli ended their T20I careers on a high as India clinched the T20 World Cup 2024 title after defeating South Africa in the summit clash. Rohit led the Indian cricket team by example as he played a number of important knocks in the competition while Kohli saved his best for the final as he slammed a gritty half-century. In the aftermath of the win, they both announced their retirements from T20Is but not before etching their names in Indian cricket folklore. However, things were not as straightforward just one year ago where there were doubts over whether the two star cricketers will continue playing in the shortest format of the sport. However, according to a report, early calls on Virat and Rohit's future with the side ultimately led to India's massive success in the T20 World Cup 2024.

During the final over, India needed to defend 16 runs, and explosive South African batsman David Miller was at the crease. On the first ball of the over, Hardik Pandya bowled a full-toss just outside off-stump, and Miller heaved it straight down the ground. The ball seemed destined to sail over the boundary rope, but Suryakumar Yadav appeared out of nowhere to take an incredible catch. His momentum took him over the boundary, but he lobbed the ball back, steadied himself, and completed a sensational effort. This catch proved crucial as India went on to win the game by 7 runs, clinching their first T20 World Cup title in 17 years1.
